# maker

## Description
This code makes it easier for me to create puzzle sets for my word game twiggle.  

Each puzzle set consists of two arrays:  one of seven letters and another of all the words that can be made from those letters within the rules of twiggle.

maker uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## History
Working on twiggle, I quickly realized that it would be helpful to have a faster way to create puzzle sets.  Typing in an array of seven letters is easy enough, but typing in an array of even just 20 words can be tedious -- and in theory a puzzle set could have more than 70 words.  So I created maker.

Thanks to the Per Scholas program for the opportunity to learn to code.  I'm particularly grateful to my instructors, Tishana Trainor, Kasper Kain and Chase Van Halen.
